MyUniAssignments is an iOS application designed to keep university students organized by displaying all upcoming assignment deadlines in an easy-to-use table view, as well as showing their university timetable, complete with classroom locations. I built this app to simplify student life by combining assignment tracking and scheduling into a single platform. Working on this project has helped me strengthen my skills in iOS development using Swift and SwiftUI, while also enhancing my ability to work with back-end integration using Firebase.
