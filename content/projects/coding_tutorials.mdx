This Web 3.0 application, built with React and Solidity, allows users to send cryptocurrency globally using blockchain technology for secure and decentralized transactions. Additionally, users can link each transaction with a GIF by entering a keyword, which fetches a related GIF using the Giphy API, creating a fun, visual transaction history.
